# mit67900_final_project

This is the repo for the final course project of Mozes Jacobs and Jonathan Geuter.

The code for the custom environment is in `custom_env.py`.
The files for training the algorithms are named `train_{algorithm}.py`.

`visualization_normal.gif` is a GIF showing our fully trained QCON agent in the normal environment, `visualization_food.gif` in the setting with 10 food and 10 starting energy, and `visualization_enemies.gif` in the setting with 8 enemies.
